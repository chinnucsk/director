h2. Honeyclient Director 

The Honeyclient Director provides a network of Erlang nodes to control and monitor daemonized tasks usually scripted in another language.

h3. Requirements:
    
  * make
  * Erlang 12b-5
  * Ruby, Rake
  * Addtionally any dependencies needed by the rake task to run

h3. Install:
 
Once Erlang is configured, copy the drone application to the "applications" directory.
In drone/config, set the configuration parameters needed in "director.yml". The following configuration parameters are required:
 
 * pidfile: a unique name for the pidfile that hold the pid of the rake task running.
 * command: the terminal command to run the task. For example 'collector:start_as_daemon'
 * phonehome: the erlang network name of the console node in the form: name@hostname. Where hostname corresponds to the result
   of the unix command "hostname -s"

To start the console application:
  Within the "director" directory run: 
  <pre>
  <code>
   ./bin/console
  </code>
  </pre>

To run a worker node:
  Within the "director" directory run: 
  <pre>
   <code>
    ./bin/node -A drone -C sample
   </code>
  </pre>

where 'sample' is the key of the desired configuration parameters in 'director.yml' file.
