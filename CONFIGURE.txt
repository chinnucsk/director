Configuring the Ruby, Perl, and Apache  processes.

With the addition of Perl and Apache  workers, there's been a slight change to the director.yml configuration 
file.  Each configuration now requires a key 'type' that specifies what type of worker
you are trying to start.  Here's a example of a configuration for each in the director.yml file:

Ruby (rake) worker:

collector_high:
  pidfile: "tmp/pids/collector_high.pid"
  command: "collector:high:start_detached"
  phonehome: "director_console@drone"
  restart:
     try: 3
     seconds: 600
  type: "ruby"

NOTE: the only change to the Ruby settings is the addition of the 'type' key. For Ruby workers need to set
this to 'ruby'. Note: all lower case.

Perl worker:

manager1:
  command: "test1.pl"
  basedir: "/Users/dbryson/projects/worker_framework/src"
  phonehome: "director_console@dave-brysons-macbook-pro"
  restart:
     try: 3
     seconds: 600
  type: "perl"


Apache Monitor:

apache:
  basedir: "FULL PATH TO THE DIRECTORY CONTAINING THE SHELL RESTART SCRIPT. Ex: /home/user/script"
  command: "NAME OF THE *SHELL* SCRIPT TO USE. Ex: restart_apache.sh"
  url: "URL OF THE WEB SERVER TO MONITOR. Ex: http://drone.mitre.org/"
  phonehome: "director_console@drone"
  restart:
    try: 3
    seconds: 600
  type: "http"


There are a couple differences here in the configuration keys:

 command: this should be the name of the perl or apache restart script to run.

 basedir: this is the root directory where the perl/apache script lives.  This should be a full path to the 
 script and the Perl/Apache script DOES NOT need to live under the "applications" folder. It can be 
 anywhere on the OS that's readable/executable 

 type: should be "perl" or "http" (for the apache monitor)


To start a worker with a Perl script it's the same as starting a Rake worker. Example:
./bin/node -A drone -C manager1

where 'drone' is the application with the config/director.yml file and 'manager1' is the configuration key
for the script.
